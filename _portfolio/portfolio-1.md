title: "Adversarial Patch Defense"
excerpt: "
Developed a robust defense pipeline against adversarial patch attacks on ImageNet by generating targeted patches and building a patch detection and segmentation model. Enhanced model resilience by covering adversarial regions prior to classification, resulting in an 83.7% improvement in Top-1 accuracy and a 12.5% gain in Top-5 accuracy on adversarial test sets.
