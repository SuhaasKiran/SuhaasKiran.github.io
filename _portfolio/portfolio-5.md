title: "Classical Image Processing"
excerpt: "
Applied a range of classical computer vision techniques—photometric stereo, depth estimation, RANSAC-based image stitching, Laplacian edge detection, Hough Transform, and SIFT—for solving foundational visual understanding tasks. Demonstrated effective 3D reconstruction, feature matching, and scene interpretation using traditional image processing pipelines.
