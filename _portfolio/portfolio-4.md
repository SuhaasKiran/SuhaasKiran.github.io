title: "Adversarial Robustness of KANs on MNIST classification"
excerpt: "
Implemented Kolmogorovâ€“Arnold Networks (KANs) and evaluated their adversarial robustness on MNIST classification under FGSM and PGD attacks. Benchmarked against CNNs and MLPs, revealing comparable performance across models, with no significant robustness advantage for KANs in this setting.
