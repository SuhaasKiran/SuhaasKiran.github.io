title: "Keypoint Detection for Whale Images"
excerpt: "
Built an automated keypoint annotation system for 750+ drone-captured whale images using YOLOv8, cutting manual labeling effort by 80%. Integrated an active learning loop that prioritized uncertain samples, leading to a 35% boost in detection accuracy while reducing labeled data needs by 66%. Enabled efficient, scalable annotation for wildlife monitoring tasks.
