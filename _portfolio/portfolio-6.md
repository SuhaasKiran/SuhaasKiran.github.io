title: "MNIST Image Generation with Generative Models"
excerpt: "
Built a suite of generative models from scratch to synthesize MNIST digits, including Autoregressive models, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Normalizing Flows, GANs, and Diffusion Models. Explored and compared the expressiveness and sample quality across these diverse generative paradigms.
