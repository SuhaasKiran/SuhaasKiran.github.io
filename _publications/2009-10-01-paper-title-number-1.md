This work addresses the limitations of deep learning-based chatbots in sustaining coherent multi-turn conversations. Starting with a baseline Seq2Seq model, we explored the impact of training variations and then introduced a reinforcement learning (RL) framework to optimize conversational coherence. The RL-enhanced chatbot showed notable improvements, including a BLEU score increase from 0.2336 to 0.3334 and a rise in average conversation length from 3.05 to 3.75 turns, demonstrating the effectiveness of RL in maintaining context over successive dialogue turns.
