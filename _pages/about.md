# About Me

Machine Learning Engineer and former Google Cloud Solutions Engineer with 4+ years of experience building scalable AI systems and LLM applications. Skilled in fine-tuning foundation models, RAG pipelines, and ML deployment with modern MLOps stacks. Proven success across research, startups, and enterprise environments. Strong academic foundation with an MS in Computer Science from UMass Amherst and a BTech in Electronics from PES University. Interested in recommender systems, computer vision, and multimodal learning.

## Experience
- **Stealth Startup, Remote**
  - *Fouding AI Engineer (April 2025 - Present)*


    Part of a pre-seed startup focused on personalized LLM applications. Led core AI initiatives including fine-tuning foundation models, building RAG pipelines, and deploying scalable LLM APIs. Collaborated closely with founding team to shape the architecture and improve user dashboard features.
    
- **Graphite.io, Remote**
  - *Research Collaborator (Feb - May 2025)*

  
    Worked on research-driven content generation systems using multi-agent LLMs and retrieval-based pipelines. Focused on improving long-form article quality through planner–writer–editor coordination and developed custom evaluation frameworks using LLM-as-a-judge.

- **DREAM Lab, University of Massachusetts Amherst**
  - *Student Researcher (Sep 2024 - March 2025)*
 
    
      Helped building scalable GNN training strategies using GPU-optimized memory and dependency management. Focused on benchmarking training performance and accuracy for link prediction tasks using libraries like DGL and PyG.

- **BioNLP Lab, University of Massachusetts Amherst**
  - *Student Researcher (October 2025 - May 2025)*
 
    
    Explored fine-grained multimodal understanding by aligning textual and visual data using VLMs like InternVL2. Proposed a novel attribute-based re-ranking approach, improving zero-shot image–text matching accuracy beyond fine-tuned baselines.

- **Google, India**
  - *Cloud Solutions Engineer (Aug 2020 - May 2023)*
 
    
    Supported enterprise clients in designing and scaling data workflows on Google Cloud. Acted as a subject matter expert for Dataflow and Composer, and built internal tools and ML-based solutions to optimize case handling, sentiment analysis, and customer reliability—impacting high-profile clients like Flipkart.

- **Infoblox, India**
  - *Software Engineering Intern (Jan 2020 - June 2020)*
 
    
    Worked on identifying and removing the functionalities not related to the DNS for NIOS (Network Identity Operating System) and running tests to assess its effects on the performance of the system.

## Career Goals


I am seeking full-time opportunities in Applied AI/ML, Research Engineering, or Applied Scientist roles. My goal is to contribute to the development of impactful machine learning systems while continuing to grow as an engineer and researcher.
